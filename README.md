Dumb algorithms to predict Red Sox wins

- [Coin Toss](https://github.com/timdotbiz/red-sox-algos/tree/main/coin-toss)
- [Mascot Ferocity](https://github.com/timdotbiz/red-sox-algos/tree/main/mascot-ferocity)

Run all algorithms from the root directory:

```sh
python taskrunner.py
```

# Coin Toss

There's a 50/50 chance the Red Sox will win any given game.

## Pros

- efficiency

## Cons

- inaccuracy: the Red Sox franchse win percentage is actually closer to 51.9% ([per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_all-time_Major_League_Baseball_win%E2%80%93loss_records))

# Mascot Ferocity

Comparing a red sock to the ferocity of the other team's mascot, predict whether the Red Sox will win.

## Pros

- efficiency

## Cons

- 'mascot ferocity' is an entirely subjective value that has no bearing on the performance of a team
